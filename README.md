# Payday 2 XP Calculator App

This is an application designed for iOS to allow users to calulate how much experience is needed to get from one level to another in the game Payday 2.

# Motivation

I had previously created a command-line version of this idea. This application is the realization of that same program on a  mobile device.

# How To Use

To use the program, first download it. This should place a zipped version of the folder within your Downloads folder or similarly-named folder. Unzip the downloaded folder. Open the XCode project. Once loaded, connect your iOS device to your computer and set your device to be the destination for the build. Have XCode run the application. 

You may need to allow you iOS device to accept this application. To do so, enter the Settings of your iOS device. Under General, navigate to Device Management. Click on Developer App. From there, allow the iPhone Developer associated with this application.

Once opened, the application will display two scroll wheels. Set the left scroll wheel to your current level and the right scroll wheel to your desired level. The amount of experienced required to get to your desired level will be displayed.
